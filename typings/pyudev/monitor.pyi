class Monitor:
    """
    A synchronous device event monitor.

    A :class:`Monitor` objects connects to the udev daemon and listens for
    changes to the device list.  A monitor is created by connecting to the
    kernel daemon through netlink (see :meth:`from_netlink`):

    >>> from pyudev import Context, Monitor
    >>> context = Context()
    >>> monitor = Monitor.from_netlink(context)

    Once the monitor is created, you can add a filter using :meth:`filter_by()`
    or :meth:`filter_by_tag()` to drop incoming events in subsystems, which are
    not of interest to the application:

    >>> monitor.filter_by('input')

    When the monitor is eventually set up, you can either poll for events
    synchronously:

    >>> device = monitor.poll(timeout=3)
    >>> if device:
    ...     print('{0.action}: {0}'.format(device))
    ...

    Or you can monitor events asynchronously with :class:`MonitorObserver`.

    To integrate into various event processing frameworks, the monitor provides
    a :func:`selectable <select.select>` file description by :meth:`fileno()`.
    However, do *not*  read or write directly on this file descriptor.

    Instances of this class can directly be given as ``udev_monitor *`` to
    functions wrapped through :mod:`ctypes`.

       recent udev versions.
